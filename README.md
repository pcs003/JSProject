## Overview

A space themed game with sets of levels taking place in a world with certain properties. The first world will be like a tutorial
world with regular gravity and no gimmicks. The goal for each level is to get the the door at the end of the level. The last 
level in a world (~5 levels per world) will have a portal to the next world. Simple 8 bit graphics. Levels will be short and there
will be no side scrolling all the content for a level wil fit on screen.
